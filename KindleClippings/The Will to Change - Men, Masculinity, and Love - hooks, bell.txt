The conflict between finding time for work and finding time for love and loved ones is rarely talked about in our nation.

...

I dont think that withholding sex is a negtive thing anyone is allowed to do this if they so please

...

He may increase his demands for sexual favors, and if that does not work, he can simply withhold sex, thus making a working woman who desires sex feel her power undermined.

...

I agree i do think there is a new wave of men who dont feel threatened by women who make more money like myself

...

In many cases when a woman’s paycheck is more than that of her male partner, he acts out to restore his sense of dominance.

...

Good point

...

Sexist men and women believe that the way to solve this dilemma is not to encourage men to share the work of emotional caretaking but rather to return to more sexist gender roles.

...

True and it should nokt be viewed this way

...

When individual men stay home to do the work of homemaking and child rearing, the arrangement is still viewed as “unnatural” by most observers.

...

I do think feminist have failed to some extent to understand male pain

...

When Faludi critiques the popular feminist notion that men are all-powerful, she counts on the ignorance of readers about feminist writing to perpetuate the notion that feminists have not understood male pain.

...

I do think the fact that its visionary suggests the idea of male pain is not properly  captured by feminism

...

Visionary feminists were writing about the fact that working-class men, far from feeling powerful, were terribly wounded by the patriarchy

...

Facts

...

everyday work experience places men in an environment where they feel powerless and where they are unable to articulate that on patriarchal terms; to use Faludi’s words, they feel “less than masculine.”

...

Just as feminist gains in this nation primarily had a positive impact on women with class privilege, the “working” men who have been given permission within the contours of patriarchal culture to reconfigure the nature of work in their lives tend to have class power.

...

True this is a good point

...

Indeed i think this is  good suggestion 

...

This film, like its predecessors, makes clear that working men must make time to get in touch with their emotional selves if they are to become men of feeling.

...

Its unfair to say what makes something popular that is trully speculation

...

Life as a House, which shows a man rejecting patriarchy and finding his way, is not as successful as American Beauty.

...

This is truy sad

...

One man talked about how his female partner was turned off by his willingness to express feelings, to tell his story; in her eyes this was weakness. She insisted that now that he was sober he did not need to “express these feelings” anymore.

...

This is powerful

...

If the intention behind the work is to seek recognition and power—“hey, look at me, I’m special, I’m important, I’m worthy of your love and respect”—then you are setting yourself apart from others as a way of trying to feel connected to them.

...

Wfh could help with this

Imagine a world where men who are unemployed for any reason could learn the way to self-actualization. Women workers find that leaving the isolation of

...

I don't like how she assumed her audience is female 

...

Say that you are feminist to most men, and automatically you are seen as the enemy. You risk being seen as a man-hating woman.

...

I dont like the assumption of a female audience

...

Groups all men together

...

Conservative antifeminist women and men insist that feminism is destroying family life.

...

I get the point but using the absolute kinda weakens her argument

...

No feminists have been accused of ongoing sexual abuse of girl children, including creating a world of child pornography featuring little girls.

...

I think the first sentence of the chapter is  prime exmple of why

...

Feminist movement was from the outset presented to most males via mass media as antimale.

...

I think this is a salient point

...

Despite this change in feminist agendas, visionary feminist thinkers who had never been antimale did not and do not receive mass media attention. As a consequence the popular notion that feminists hate men continues to prevail.

...

Oof I sensed as much

...

Sadly there is no body of recent feminist writing addressing men that is accessible, clear, and concise.

...

I think this is an interesting topic I don't  hear enough on

...

Teachers of children see gender equality mostly in terms of ensuring that girls get to have the same privileges and rights as boys within the existing social structure; they do not see it in terms of granting boys the same rights as girls—for instance, the right to choose not to engage

...

Very interesting point

...

Men were expected to hold on to the ideas about strength and providing for others that were a part of patriarchal thought, while dropping their investment in domination and adding an investment in emotional growth. This vision of feminist masculinity was so fraught with contradictions, it was impossible to realize. No wonder then that men who cared, who were open to change, often just gave up, falling back on the patriarchal masculinity they found so problematic.

...

This is an interesting argument but i wish she gave statistics

...

overcooked broccoli dominated by powerful females who were secretly longing for his macho counterpart, masses of men lost interest. Reacting to this inversion of gender roles, men who were sympathetic chose to stop trying to play a role in female-led feminist movement and became involved with the men’s movement.

...

By who

...

the question of what the alternative to patriarchal masculinity might be must still be answered.

...

I think linking it to genitalia is reductive

...

Male being, maleness, masculinity must stand for the essential core goodness of the self, of the human body that has a penis. Many of the critics who have written about masculinity suggest that we need to do away with the term, that we need “an end to manhood.” Yet such a stance furthers the notion that there is something inherently evil, bad, or unworthy about maleness.

...

This is a nice answer

...

but by asking that they allow its meaning to be transformed, that they become disloyal to patriarchal masculinity

...

Reframing it as fighting dominator culture may be nice way to reach those who oppose feminism

...

Dominator culture

...

This is an excellent explanation of the root cause

...

dominate is more biologically hardwired in males than in females. In actuality, dominator culture teaches us that we are all natural-born killers but that males are more able to realize the predator role.

...

These are the seven pillrs that chain men

integrity, self-love, emotional awareness, assertiveness, and relational skill, including the capacity to be empathic, autonomous, and connected.”

...

This is very interesting

...

whether a male with the qualities described above can survive.

...

The patriarchy is killing men

...

Men aren’t surviving very well! We send them to war to kill and be killed. They’re lying down in the middle of highways to prove their manhood in imitation of a scene in a recent movie about college football. They’re dying of heart attacks in early middle age, killing themselves with liver and lung disease via the manly pursuits of drinking and smoking, committing suicide at roughly four times the rate of women, becoming victims of homicide (generally at the hands of other men) three times as often as women, and therefore living about eight years less than women.

...

Its the fear that when violence is needed men wont be ble to provide it is the source of our fierce attachment to patriarchical masculinity 

...

“I refuse to tell you what makes a good morani [warrior]. But I will tell you what makes a great morani. When the moment calls for fierceness, a good morani is very ferocious. And when the moment calls for kindness, a good morani is utterly tender. Now, what makes a great morani is knowing which moment is which.”

...

This rings true

...

power of patriarchy has been to make maleness feared and to make men feel that it is better to be feared than to be loved. Whether they can confess this or not, men know that it just is not true.

...

Look into these

The Male Machine, Men’s Liberation, The Liberated Man, The Limits of Masculinity, For Men against Sexism, Being

I wouldnt classify this as entertainment 

...

Male domination of women simply became a new form of mass entertainment (hence the money-making spectacle of the O. J. Simpson trial).

...

Masculinity is very much tied to racism 

...

“There is indeed a close interaction between the predominant Western conception of manhood and that of racial (and species) domination.

...

I think she picks bd examples itlmost feels like she didnt watch the same movie as i did

...

Recent movies like Men in Black, Independence Day, and The Matrix

...

She thinks racism deflects away from white male patriarchy 

...

mass media demonization of black males as the epitome of brutal patriarchal masculinity deflects attention away from the patriarchal masculinity of white men and its concomitant woman-hating.

...

She literally wants to drink the tears of men thats kinda weird

...

They pulled wrinkled handkerchiefs out of their pockets and poured tears in them, as if they were pouring milk into a cup. She wanted to drink those tears that like milk could nourish her and help her grow.

...

I think this is an interesting perspective

...

When feminist women insist that all men are powerful oppressors who victimize from the location of power, they obscure the reality that many victimize from the location of victimization.

...

There needs to be a recreation of what it means to be male

...

I am always disturbed when male students request references to literature that will serve as a guide as they struggle to interrogate patriarchy and create progressive identities,

...

Good recs

...

The Brother from Another Planet and his most recent film, Sunshine State. I called attention to Alice Walker’s novel The Color Purple.

...

You can't have both being masculine and having connections

...

In reality, the more patriarchal a man is, the more disconnected he must be from feeling. If he cannot feel, he cannot connect. If he cannot connect, he cannot be intimate.

...

You shouldnt bow down to anything

we must dare to proclaim our adoration, to bow down not to the male as dominator, but to the

Their piece of the pie

...

They were not mad at their powerful daddies and husbands who kept poor men exploited and oppressed; they were mad that they were not being giving equal access to power. Now that many of those women have gained power, and especially economic parity with the men of their class, they have pretty much lost interest in feminism.

...

I like this redefinition of masculine strength

...

Rather than defining strength as “power over,” feminist masculinity defines strength as one’s capacity to be responsible for self and others.

...

Good redefinition of power

...

Is the true self always  good?

...

The stress of guarding and protecting a false self

...

Sounds like she is conflating compulsion with masculinity

...

Men suffer depression frequently because of their own unfulfilled expectations or their perfectionism (which can never be satisfied since to be human is to be imperfect).

...

I dont think this is true but sometimes they encourge growth in the wrong direction

...

their manhood, is affirmed by a lack of interest in personal growth;

...

This implies the true self is not always good

...

be, if I contemplate it and analyze it and isolate it, and identify it, then I can go about the process of killing it and purifying myself of it.

...

She has a good point here about getting power through lying actually harms the total power gained rather than increasing it

...

All too often we are led to believe that men gain more power through lying and compartmentalization. It just simply is not so.

...

Ive heard people say this often and i dont know if i agreee

...

Anger often hides depression and profound sorrow.

...

Ive heard people say this often and i dont know if i agree sometimes anger is anger

...

Males are not given the emotional space to grieve. Girls and women can cry, can express sorrow throughout our lives. We can just let it out. Males are still being taught to keep it in and, worse, to deny that they feel like crying.

...

When my dad died and i went to the gay pride parade i felt like this

...

Depression often masks the inability to grieve. Males are not given the emotional space to grieve. Girls and women can cry, can express sorrow throughout our lives. We can just let it out. Males are still being taught to keep it in and, worse, to deny that they feel like crying. Donald Dutton in his chapter “Love and Rage” says that male refusal to acknowledge loss is a key component of male rage:

...

I feel like its easiest for me to grieve on an individual  basis

...

Male models for grieving are few…. Men in particular seem incapable of grieving and mourning on an individual basis.

...

I dont think you should change yourself for  woman though! You should change for yourself.

...

If a man is not willing to break patriarchal rules that say that he should never change—especially to satisfy someone else, particularly a female—then

...

Being responsible for your self and others is a good redefinition of masculinity

...

Again, it is taking responsibility that sets me free.

...

Being responsible is controlling but lso knowing when to let go 

...

which requires knowing when to control and when to surrender and let go.

...

Shes using perfectionism in the same way i would use stocism and stubbornness 

...

perfectionism and accepting vulnerability.

...

I agree this is something i push back against

...

feminist critiques of masculinity was the absence of any affirmation of that which is positive and potentially positive in male being.

...

I think this is a very useful way to get men into feminisim

...

Indeed, recognizing all the ways that males have been victimized by patriarchy (even though they received rewards) was a way of including men in feminist movement, welcoming their presence and honoring their contribution.

...

Say what is good is the same as affirm

...

Critical analysis is useful when it promotes growth, but it is never enough. The work of affirmation is what brings us together.

...

Should use joy here but thought taken

Small acts of mercy are a way to affirm

...

Interesting take onwhy men arent born killers

...

However, if men were natural-born killers, hardwired by biology and destiny to take life, then there would be no need for patriarchal socialization to turn them into killers.

...

Affirmation of the opposing argument 

...

I appreciate some of his traits—like courage, teamwork, loyalty—but the archetype itself is bankrupt at this point in history.

...

Interesting tie in with the other chapter om wholeness and it being important to being powerful

...

Communities of resistance should be places where people can return to themselves more easily, where the conditions are such that they can heal themselves and recover their wholeness.

...

I wish it were instictual but i dont think it is

...

It may be that this double sense of singular integrity and of communal belonging is our personal standard of health for as long as we live…we seem to know instinctively that health is not divided.

...

Is it instictual or not?

...

When our families are functional and not shaped by a dominator model and the patriarchal thinking that comes in its wake, the model of health Berry describes can become the norm.

...

Indeed it is a spectrum

...

There will be boys whose personalities will be somewhere in between these two paradigms.

We read self-help books that tell us all the time that we cannot change anyone, and this is a useful truism. It is however equally true that when we give love, real love—not the emotional exchange of I will give you what you want if you give me what I want, but genuine care, commitment, knowledge, responsibility, respect, and trust—it can serve as the seductive catalyst for change.

...

If the patrirchy was less prevalent gay and straight would be less of a thing with men

If all men were in touch with primal positive passion, the categories of gay and straight would lose their charged significance.
