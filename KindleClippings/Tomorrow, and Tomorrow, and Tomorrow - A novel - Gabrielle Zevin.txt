upward. Those heterochromic eyes looked at him with mirth.

...

lightly damp, just past her shoulder blades. There was no echt

Damn i knew someone like this

...

Hannah Levin at the end of the weekend. Dear Sadie, I played your “game,” and I honestly don’t know what to say. It is disgusting and offensive, and you are a sick person. I’m cc’ing Dov on this email. I’m not sure if I will be able to attend class, because I’m too disturbed. This class is no longer a safe space for me.—Hannah

...

Oh shes so stupid and dov is such an asshole

...

She didn’t find out he was married until about four months in, as her sophomore year was ending.

...

he hadn’t been, he was the kind of well-traveled cicerone

...

Damn what the fuck happened this time

...

Sadie’s instinct had been to tell Sam, but they weren’t speaking at the time.

...

and shovel, Ichigo must find their way home. A bromide

...

They

...

Lmfaooo i love his mom

...

“It seems like a big age gap now, but it won’t in a couple of years.”

...

LLC, Go, Ichigo,

...

Dov sounds grosss lol

...

Marx hated him immediately: the leather pants, the tight black T-shirt, the heavy silver jewelry, the immaculate goatee,

...

Marx is my favorite character lol

...

Marx pulled Sam into the bedroom. “You didn’t say that Sadie used to be Dov’s girlfriend,” Marx said to Sam.

...

you, brilliant one.” He took her in his hirsute

...

“Where will you stay?” Sam asked. “At

...

Oh sadie you're  so smart but so stupid

...

“At Dov’s,” she said. There was no drama in her voice. “He’s producing with us now, and he said he had an extra room that I could use.” Everyone knew this was a lie.

...

Anders, born in Sweden, was exactly the kind of decent, guileless

...

He lost his mother in the car crash :(

...

It might take your mother, but it might give you someone else in return.

...

In the streetlight,

...

First time we get a hint at the title meaning

...

immaculate tomorrows,

...

What the fuck kind of relatinship is this

...

He liked making her strip and tying her up and gagging her on occasion; he liked to slap her and spank her and pull her hair. He liked shaving off her pubic hair, which he did with the care and consideration of an artist. He had peed on her once, but when she told him to stop, he had, and he’d never done it again. When he hurt her—and he never hurt her much—he was always tender and sorry after.

...

Dov is not as old as I thought

...

thirtieth birthday,

...

This is a fucken lie

...

“You won’t have to,” Dov said. “I promise.”

...

He took too much credit in a subtle way what an asshole

...

Listen, Ulysses shouldn’t take away from anything Sadie and Sammy did. The amount of work those two kids did was astounding. I cite them as an example to my students of how much two kids and a couple of computers can get done on their own. Game companies have gotten too big and impersonal. You have ten guys doing texture layers, and ten guys doing modeling and ten guys doing backgrounds, and someone else is writing the story, and someone else is writing the dialogue, and literally, no one ever talks to each other. They’re like zombies, with their heads in their cubicles. It’s a [expletive] nightmare.

...

She does a good job of writing misogyny realistically

...

Aaron Opus nodded. He studied Sam’s face, and then he studied Sadie’s face, and then he turned his attention back to Sam. “The little fella, Ichigo. He looks a lot like you,” Aaron Opus said. He nodded some more, as if deciding something. “Mm-hmm. You’re the face of the game, I reckon.”

...

And the only women not a coincidence smh

...

By the end of the night, Marx, Dov, and Sam were on the side of Opus. Sadie was the only holdout for Cellar Door.

...

Is this the conflict that caused them to stop talking

...

“Why do you suddenly care about money? You’re twenty-two, how much money do you need? If you wanted to make money, you never should have made the game. You could have done Harvard recruiting, and ended up with a six-figure job at Bear Stearns, like everyone else in your class.” “You’ve never been poor,” Sam said,

...

Damn life is sad

...

“I’ll do whatever you want,” he said. “Okay, Sam,” she said. “Opus it is.”

...

No shit sherlock

...

Dov was in Israel, visiting his son and his wife, who two years later, he still hadn’t managed to divorce.

...

Great repitition

...

To return to the city of one’s birth always felt like retreat.

...

Damn he sexually assaulted her wtf

...

She didn’t fight him. She let it happen. He reached under her skirt, between her legs, and he yanked her underwear off, and then he threw it across the room. He wouldn’t have sex without her consent, but he felt free to make her uncomfortable and embarrassed.

...

Oh hes fit i didnt know that

...

mesomorphic

...

I love them lol this conversation is so cute

...

“You can’t know that,” Sadie said. “We could have met at some other time. Our childhood homes were five miles apart, and we went to colleges that were less than two miles apart. We could have met in Cambridge. Or we could have met before that, at one of those smart-kid things in L.A. that you were always shooting me those dirty looks at. Don’t deny it—” “You were my mortal enemy!”

...

I love this 

...

They had been worried about him, and they had wanted to make his life easier. And so they invented reasons—some of them even compelling and real. And they had not done this for the game or the company, but because they loved him, and they were his friends. And he felt grateful.

...

Oof so real so well written such a good example of misogyny 

...

“Okay, so I’m going to have you meet with Chip now. The thing you need to know about Chip is that he’s super old-school, right? He’s not a bad guy, but he’s not into, as he puts it, any women’s lib stuff—he’s fine with women, but he doesn’t want to hear about it.

...

Nice hints on the mom dying in the car crash and sadie by sadie not recognizing the women in the poster

...

Korean beer called JjokJjok, and her face was on a fifty-foot-wide billboard on Wilshire, with the slogan “What’s the most beautiful woman in Koreatown drinking?”

...

This is where i thought the mother died zevin tricked me lol 

...

a blur of fur darted in front of their car. Anna hit the brakes and swerved a little. The animal froze. In the headlights, Anna could see it was a medium-sized dog, or perhaps a coyote, with blondish fur. An all-American.

...

I think she is assuming a lotof sam here i dont think sam did this

...

Sadie clearly remembered Sam saying that he hadn’t known Dov was her boyfriend or her teacher. But if he had used this disk to play Dead Sea—and she knew that he had—he would have read this inscription. He wouldn’t have been able to miss it, and Sam never missed anything anyway. And if Sam had known that Dov was her boyfriend, had he turned to Dead Sea, not randomly, but specifically? Had he shown her the game because he’d wanted Sadie to go to Dov, because he knew she would go to Dov? And didn’t it follow that he would have guessed that the bad breakup she had had was with Dov, and that Sam hadn’t paused, even for one moment, to consider what going back to him would mean for her? How different would the last three years have been if Dov hadn’t had so much professional and personal power over her? If it was true, it was absolutely a betrayal. Sam had wanted what he wanted, and he hadn’t cared what it would mean for Sadie. He had wanted Ulysses, in the same way he had wanted the deal with Opus, in the same way he didn’t truly care if Ichigo was a boy, in the same way he let everyone in the world believe Ichigo was his game, in the same way he had renewed their friendship for the sole purpose of making a game in the first place. She let herself think Sam was her friend, but Sam was no one’s friend.

...

restaurant and the podiatrist in question. The sign pirouetted

...

It's the lack of communication

...

Sadie had killed herself building Oneiric, and she was irritated by his muted reaction.

...

It's the lack of communication that erroded the relationship

...

Sadie is a bit of an aszshole here

...

“No,” Sadie said. “I used to waste a lot of time worrying about him, but he’s the kind of person who tends to go missing.”

...

Sadie is a bit of an asshole here

...

Marx falls in love deeply

...

“I’m afraid I’ve given you the wrong impression, Sadie,” he said. “I rather like to be consumed.”

...

Is marx going to cheat oh no :(

...

“I understand why you’d say that, but I also don’t think you should give up on the devouring yet.” Marx growled at her and pretended to bite her, and then he kissed her on the cheek.

...

This is very interesting 

...

Including Lola, Sam had had four different sexual partners in his life, and he had never enjoyed sex with any of them. He had slept with one boy and three girls. While no one had ever mistreated him, sex had given him considerably less pleasure than masturbation. He did not like to be naked in front of other people. He did not like the messiness of sex—its fluids, its sounds, its smells.

...

This was weird and sweet

...

Lola looked at the stump appraisingly, and then she shrugged again. “It’s not that bad. It was probably worse before. Now it’s finished-looking, at least.” She put her warm hand over the stump, and it felt different than when he touched it or when a doctor touched it. She ran her index finger along the red-and-pink scar that looked like a firmly closed mouth, and a slightly pleasurable, slightly painful electricity coursed up and down his spine. She bent down and kissed it once, leaving the red stamp of her lips. He was going to tell her to stop, but he really was too high, and then it was over anyway. She squeezed the stump with her hand and she sat back up. “You’re going to be okay, Masur. I swear.”

...

I feel like a threesome is about to happen

...

Damn im a good predictor

...

Zoe kissed Sadie on the mouth.

...

So true 

...

“That is so typical of you,” Sam said. “Sit there and suffer and don’t tell anyone what’s wrong.” “You’re the one who does that,” Sadie said.

...

That really isnt on Sam 

...

“Ichigo is about a boy who has been lost at sea, but it’s also about a mother who has lost her child. I never had a child, but I might have…”

...

I agree lol devolving had this prpblem

...

“that Americans hate umlauts. Sorry, guys.”

...

I agree lol devolving had this problem

...

the whiteboard was no longer white, and its permanent palimpsest

...

Damn sadie is horny for marx

...

She surprised herself by hoping that the idea would be sex. It turned out to be business.

...

Just like dov

...

“You’re easy to please,” Marx said. He wiped a smudge of egg salad from the side of her mouth.

...

Mhmmm sadie is so horny for marx

...

“But I do think it would be a good idea if we slept together,” she said. “We’re in a different country, and the sex you have when you’re away doesn’t have to count, in my opinion.”

...

Sadie is a bit pretentious 

...

“Well, I learned to program computers in middle school. I got an eight hundred on my math SAT, won a Westinghouse and a Leipzig. And then I went to MIT, which by the way is highly competitive, even for a lowly female like myself, and studied computer science. At MIT, I learned four or five more programming languages and studied psychology, with an emphasis on ludic techniques and persuasive designs, and English, including narrative structures, the classics, and the history of interactive storytelling. Got myself a great mentor. Regrettably made him my boyfriend. Suffice it to say, I was young. And then I dropped out of school for a time to make a game because my best frenemy wanted me to. That game became the game you never heard of, but yeah, it sold around

...

Sam never did anything and that was for the best 

...

And at the wedding, Sadie’s grandmother would shoot sympathetic looks at Sam, because she had always been nice to him, and she would know he was brokenhearted.

...

Ugh what a cliche shouldve written it differently 

...

A tragedy. He would know that if he hadn’t been the person he was, terrified and cowardly and petty and insecure and sexually panicked and broken, Sadie might have been his.

...

Why does he drive with his left foot lol

...

The first time he attempted it in the opposite direction, he had a panic attack where he could not feel the brake under his prosthetic.

...

They are no longver friends not really

...

Sam was put off by Sadie’s laughter. He asked her what was funny. She was confused for a moment—hadn’t he wanted her to laugh?—and then she said, annoyed, “You get that this is a story about you, right? That’s why you lost your mind at a dog park. You’re Tuesday. You’re the incredibly special dog that no one can classify.” It was not long after their huge argument, and things were quite strained between them. Sam told her that she was being reductive, and that her interpretation was insulting to both him and the dog. “It’s a story about Tuesday,” he insisted. “Maybe it’s a story about L.A., too. Maybe it’s a story about the kind of people that go to the dog park in Silver Lake. But it’s mainly a story about Tuesday.” “The text,” she said, “perhaps.”

...

I love this stpry line of sam getting over sadie

...

“But there were too many Korean places in K-town, so we had to come up with something else. And that’s why we decided to make pizza. There weren’t any other pizza places in that part of K-town. It was scary, at first, because we didn’t know anything about pizza, but then we set ourselves to learning about pizza. We didn’t have any choice. We had two babies and bills to pay. “Your cousin Albert told me that, in business, they call this a pivot. But life is filled with them, too. The most successful people are also the most able to change their mindsets. You may not ever have a romantic relationship with Sadie, but you two will be friends for the rest of your lives, and that is something

...

A habitual student fucker lol

...

Not long after New Year’s 2002, Dov called Sadie with two pieces of news: (1) he was, at long last, getting divorced, and (2) he was getting married in Tiburon to a former student, a young woman a few classes behind Sadie at MIT.

...

Damn sadie is really mean to Sam

...

She, too, used to feel such devotion, before she’d seen Sam for who he really was.

...

He's  being cruel

...

“Why wouldn’t I be into him?” She knew she shouldn’t ask this question. “Because he’s boring.” Sam shrugged, as if Marx’s banality was an indisputable fact. “That’s why he’s always dating someone new. He gets bored with people, but it’s not about them, it’s because he’s boring.” “You’re an incredible asshole,” Sadie said. “Marx loves you. Can’t you ever just be nice?” “It’s not cruel to state a fact.” “It isn’t a fact. And sometimes, it is cruel to state a fact.” “When we took Heroes for Zeroes at Harvard, you know what his favorite part of The Iliad was?”

...

Sam's  being cruel

...

Sadie is cruel to sam as well perhaps they have become cruel to one another

...

“I don’t want to be making Ichigo until I’m forty, Sam. I’m not like you. I don’t get off on doing the same things over and over again.”

...

These are both true facts they bring out the worse in each other 

...

“You’re pretentious, Sadie.” “You’re a pandering asshole.”

...

Marx is a really good guy sadie and sam are kinda shitty people

...

Marx would have liked this to be true, but Sadie knew he was mistaken.

...

I would actually love if sadies game fails

...

Revels, the gamer plays from the point of view of multiple characters, all linked in some way to the murder of Christopher Marlowe: Marlowe’s lover; a rival playwright; a twenty-first-century

...

Allows for additional color vision can only occur in women

...

tetrachromat, the two reds are distinctive.

...

Sadie is trippy

...

Some hours later, you become aware of someone holding your hand, which means you have a hand, which means you are not a bird, which means you must be on some pretty terrific drugs, like LSD, which you have never done even though Zoe always wanted you guys to do LSD together, said she knew the perfect guide. For a second, you experience competing melancholies: sadness that you cannot fly, sadness that you didn’t do LSD with Zoe, sadness that

...

Sadie is tripping

...

Sadie is tripping no apparently marx is tripping wouldve been better if it was sadie cause tetrachromat only occurs in women

...

Oh no is thiz marx dying

...

I love you. all ok. Just kids. Talking. TOH.

...

But you'll  be in a relarionship lmfaooo sadie is so stupid and insecure sometimes smh

...

She said that she didn’t want to be married to her business partner.

...

Oh sam is such an incel.such a baby im glad marx got with sadie now

...

“I wish I’d never met you,” Sam says. “I wish we’d never been roommates. I wish I’d never introduced you to Sadie.” Sam is starting to slur his words. “Sadie doesn’t belong to you.” “She does,” Sam says. “She’s mine. And you knew that, and you pursued her anyway.”

...

It wouldve been better if it was someone else someone not marx

...

“I love you, brother. You’re my best friend.”

...

I see it was planned 

...

You and Sadie began referring to the baby as Tamagotchi Watanabe Green.

...

You is a word that depends on its context

...

deictic

...

This is how you deal with death 

...

“Okay, so you spoke to her. She was definitely not a ghost. Did she ever reply?”

...

This is what you were trying to tell matty about death and how one must deal with it 

...

Bong Cha narrowed her eyes at Sam, deciding if her grandson was trying to trick her into appearing foolish. “Yes, in my mind, she did. I knew your mother so well I could play her part. The same with my own mother and my grandmother and my childhood best friend, Euna, who drowned in the lake by her cousin’s house. There are no ghosts, but up here”—she gestured toward her head—“it’s a haunted house.” She squeezed Sam’s hand and inelegantly changed the subject. “It’s time you learned how to drive.”

...

Sadie is quite cruel

...

What should we do about the office? Five minutes passed before Sadie replied, Do what you want.

...

Sam has grown as a character 

...

What would Marx say? Marx, Sam decided, would take a second to empathize with Sadie’s situation. Sadie was pregnant. She had not only lost her business partner, she had lost her life partner. Unlike Sam, Sadie had had no significant experience with loss or grief. It was harder for Sadie.

...

Sadie is quite cruel to sam it was her idea to do the marriage in ichigo its more her fault than sam. Ironic that she felt guilty that sam was taking most of the heat but in the end she lost the most.

...

A memory from Marx’s hospital room: Without preamble, Sadie is screaming at Sam, They wanted you. They wanted you. They wanted you. She beats his chest with her fists, and he doesn’t try to stop her. Harder, he thinks. Please.

...

Fucken sadie

...

“No, I do not want to look at it, Sam. I do not want to fucking look at it! What is wrong with you?”

...

I hate sadie

...

“That’s brave,” Sadie said, but there was a meanness to her tone, and he could tell that she was about to commence a new argument.

...

Wow sadie is a piece of shit 

...

“Sadie, I’m telling you the truth. I spoke to our accountant this morning. You can call him yourself.” “It’s just you have a way of bending reality to suit your own agenda.” “What agenda do I have? Except to get our people back to work.” “I don’t know, Sam. What agenda could you have?” “I don’t want our company to close. That’s my agenda. Marx would want the same thing.” “Marx doesn’t want anything anymore,” she said. “You know what, Sam? Do what you will. You always do.” “Are you okay?” “What do you think?” She hung up the phone.

...

Sam is growing on me again

...

“Honestly, what the hell is wrong with you?” Sam said. “Marx is dead. I have neither the time nor the desire to look for your husband’s portfolio, or to hear your insipid game pitch.” “I’m sorry,” Charlotte said. Her voice sounded weepy, and this pissed Sam off more than he already was. Sadie had been awful on the phone, but she hadn’t cried. What right did this stranger have to cry? “I know it’s a terrible time. I know. I just need our materials back. If you could—”

...

This was fucked up of sa

...

Do you think you suffer more than I do? Do you think you’re the first person to ever have a baby? Or lose someone? Do you think you’re some goddamned pioneer when it comes to grief?”

...

Sam is cold wtf 

...

“Snap out of it, Sadie. Come to the office. We work through our pain. That’s what we do. We put the pain into the work, and the work becomes better. But you have to participate. You have to talk to me. You can’t ignore me and our company and everything that came before. Everything isn’t over because Marx is dead.” “I can’t go back there, Sam.” “Then you’re weaker than I thought,” Sam said.

...

This is very sweet homage to Marx

...

“No, I like this, but I don’t know if I understand it yet,” Sam said. “Why don’t you tell me how you see it?”

...

So this is what the title means

...

“Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow”

...

This sadie may be lost to sam

...

Keep it simple, Sadie said. That’s always served you well. I’m the one who always makes games too complicated. Maybe you could even use the Mapleworld engines. There’s no reason you shouldn’t. They probably have one or two more games in them before they’re completely obsolete.

...

Daedalus,” Emily averred. She carefully returned the horse to the menagerie.

...

This is such a weird departure in the book i hate it lol

...

Emily looked at Dr. Daedalus. They were dressed identically, in the wardrobe typical of Friendship merchants: black skirt, white blouse with black tie. Dr. Daedalus was shorter than Emily, and her skin was pale and cast with undertones of verdigris. Her curly hair was the indigo black of comic book characters, and her round eyes, beneath her round glasses, were emerald and large. To depict her, Emily thought, I would require a great many circles. “Your eyes remind me of someone I used to know,” Emily observed. “Where do you come from?”

...

Lol are these npcs or other humans

...

“What is a ‘screen’?” Emily asked. “It is my own term for a length of land. It’s very useful, so I’m hoping to force it into a broader parlance. For example, your house in the Upper Foglands is three screens from Alabaster Brown’s house.” Emily and the doctor smiled at each other, as if they had a secret.

...

Shes playing sams game

...

PIONEERS MEMBERSHIP

...

I think sadie wants her cke and to eat it too you can't  have true privacy and intimacy at the same timd

...

“Daedalus, I have found that the most intimate relationships allow for a great deal of privacy within them.”

...

I think sadie wants her cke and to eat it too you can't  have true privacy and intimacy at the same time

...

The portal that gets you from cabin to cave in the game that inspired both sides

...

Xyzzy

...

This is the only way sam could communicate with Sadie

...

The recovery was short physically, but long emotionally. Daedalus was quite despondent and refused to leave her house or even her bedroom. For a time, she would neither speak to nor even see Ludo Quintus.

...

First ichigo

...

“Fifth game.”

...

She wants to hate sam so much

...

EMILYBMARXX: ……… DAEDALUS84: I miss you, Sadie. I want to be in your life…A mistake I have made in the past. There is no purity to bearing pain alone.

...

This is marx

...

He looks, she thought, like his father, Ryu.

...

She can be cool with dov but hates sam lol i don't get it 

...

“I did and I didn’t. I think it’s like when you’re watching a true crime show. People always think the cops are so hapless. How could they not see who the killer is when there are so many clues pointing in that direction?

...

HE made the mazes for the minotaur

...

Daedalus!

...

Yeah her hate of Sam doesn't make sense

...

“To my point, I did that, and you still have brunch with me whenever I’m in L.A.,” Dov said. “And you weren’t my student when I did that. I’m quite sure of that.”

...

Destiny also thought this

...

Sam felt, was incomplete, and thus, not fully satisfying. The simulation was incomplete because it didn’t have a call to action. The only feeling a player could have at the end of Sadie’s game was nihilism. Sam fully got what she was trying to do, but he also believed that she would have to do more if she were to make games that people loved, not just games that people admired.

...

Sam thought this as well

...

“I liked the idea of it, and I like that the game is political. But if I had a critique, it’s that the game is too nihilistic. After you figure out what the factory is making, the game gets…” Destiny searched for the right word. “…well, repetitive, I guess. It should move on to a different part of the game instead.”

...

It was sam

...

“It’s a long story.” Sadie recognized the look in Destiny’s eyes. She knew what it was to be ravenous with ambition but to have your reach exceed your grasp. “I’m not sure I have a simple answer,” Sadie admitted. “May I think about it and get back to you?”

...

Wow sadie is pretty shitty lol

...

part: (1) wanting to distinguish herself enough professionally so that everyone at MIT would know that Sadie Green had not been admitted to the college on a girl curve, (2) wanting Dov to know that he shouldn’t have dumped her, and (3) wanting Sam to know that he was lucky to be working with her, that she was the great programmer in their team, that she was the one with the big ideas.

...

the only thing sam did wrong was looking at her ip address

...

On the day she found Daedalus blowing the glass heart, she had suspected Sam, but she had also allowed herself not to know. She wanted to play more than she wanted to know. Sadie told Sam he had tricked her, but the truth was, she had tricked herself. It was embarrassing how much that silly, exquisite world had meant to her.

...

I do believe this is how it worked

...

She had once read in a book about consciousness that over the years, the human brain makes an AI version of your loved ones. The brain collects data, and within your brain, you host a virtual version of that person. Upon the person’s death, your brain still believes the virtual person exists, because, in a sense, the person still does. After a while, though, the memory fades, and each year, you are left with an increasingly diminished version of the AI you had made when the person was alive.

...

This is funny but not funny haha that sam is her child

...

Sadie had trained herself not to look for Marx in Naomi’s face. Sometimes, unexpectedly, she saw Sam’s there. Naomi was half-Asian and half–Eastern European Jewish, so Naomi was closer in background to Sam than she was to Sadie or to Marx.

...

I do believe this is how it works but it need not be this wy keeping someone alive in your head is an excercise. The people in your head fade be ause inevitably you stop bringing them up in your mind. It need not be this way you can bring them up in your mind nd modern technology makes it easier eith videos, audio recordings, and pictures

...

This reminds me of conor

...

“I love you, too, Grandpa.” For most of his life, Sam had found it difficult to say I love you.

...

This is so true 

...

But now, it seemed like one of the easiest things in the world Sam could do. Why wouldn’t you tell someone you loved them? Once you loved someone, you repeated it until they were tired of hearing it. You said it until it ceased to have meaning. Why not? Of course, you goddamn did.

...

Shes a victim of dovs predation

...

“No,” Sadie said. “I honestly can’t imagine wanting to sleep with anyone in their twenties, forget about their teens. I always feel like I should add, Dov was a great teacher. I don’t know what my impulse to defend him is.”

...

Doesn't Sam know with his mothers death perhas he wants to know how sadie gt over marx

...

“Wow, that is amazingly naive,” Sadie said. “The belief that someone on the internet knows the truth about anything.” “I’ve been blue, lately,” Sam admitted. “And I wondered, how do you get over that sort of thing?”

...

No sadie you make sam miserable

...

“Oh God, Sam, why would we do that? We make each other miserable.”

...

This is true it is sadie

...

“It’s not just you. It’s me.

...

I hate this play the author needs more tools than sex

...

“Why do you think we never got together?”

...

Shes not wrong

...

“It’s so funny you should say this, because if you were one of my students, you’d be wearing your pain like a badge of honor. This generation doesn’t hide anything from anyone. My class talks a lot about their traumas. And how their traumas inform their games. They, honest to God, think their traumas are the most interesting thing about them. I sound like I’m making fun, and I am a little, but I don’t mean to be. They’re so different from us, really. Their standards are higher; they call bullshit on so much of the sexism and racism that I, at least, just lived with. But that’s also made them kind of, well, humorless. I hate people who talk about generational differences like it’s an actual thing, and here I am, doing it. It doesn’t make sense. How alike were you to anyone we grew up with, you know?”

...

Indeed sadie is awful but so is sam

...

She was like, ‘Mine Sadie, bad things happen to everyone. Enough already.’

...

that had only taken her the better part of two decades to understand.

...

Indeed it toom her a long time
