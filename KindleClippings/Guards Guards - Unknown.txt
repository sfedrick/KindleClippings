This cracked me up that gender is optional

. A dwarf is not considered old enough to have the technical processes explained to him1 until he has reached puberty.2

Brother dumbasses

...

Brother Fingers, isn’t it?”

...

Leader of the brothers of dumbasses is turned into a dragon

...

When he opened his eyes again he was in a dark alley, his stomach was full of fre, and he was very angry

...

He's  always muttering something lol

...

Brother Dunnykin.

...

Is cor god?

Cor

...

Telling people to mend youhr ways

...

That and the fact that he kept hitting people and telling them to Mend their Ways.

...

It wasn’t just the loneliness, it was the back-to-front way of living. That was it, thought Vimes

...

Corporal are actually below sergeant lol

...

...

Captain are above

Can nobby literally do this

...

Nobby was outside the Drum, hopping from one foot to another. In times of danger he had a way of propelling himself from place to place without apparently moving through the intervening space which

...

Nobby is a rascal lol

...

Safest way, sir,” said Nobby

Funnily

I don't get this joke

...

And you wouldn’t happen to know what’s in it?” Vimes sighed. “What? Oh. Four words,” he said wearily. “First word. Sounds like. Bend. Bough? Sow, cow, how . . . How. Second word. Small word. The, a, to . . . To. Yes understood, but I meant in any kind of detail? No. I see.”

...

Cut me own throat sells dragon cream

...

What you’re saying,” said Vimes slowly, “if I understand the wording correctly, is that if I am baked alive by the dragon you’ll return the money?”

...

This is the guy that sold the crock amulet lol

...

One dollar a jar, and I’m cutting my own throat. It’s a public service, really,”

...

What the fuck was he gonna do with the dog

...

A small wire-haired terrier, I think,” said Vimes. The hunter thought about this for some time. “Nah,” he said eventually, and hurried off after the others.

...

Dearest

...

Who da fuck is reet

...

Reet

...

Why did he give the spoon back ???

...

You two can bloody well stop that,” he said. “Why shouldn’t I know a lady when I sees one? She give me a cup of tea in a cup fn as paper and a silver spoon in it,” he said, speaking as one who had peeped over the plateau of social distinction. “And I give it back to her, so you can stop looking at me like that!

...

I like how he time skips and leves stuff to the imagination 

...

And now it was two of the clock the following morning. And all was well, apart from the rain. It was drizzling again. There

Poor old gaskin

...

“Well. Anyway. And there he was,” said Colon. “Captain Vimes was very upset about it. You shouldn’t run fast in the Watch, lad,” he said solemnly. “You can be a fast guard or you can be an old guard, but you can’t be a fast old guard. Poor old Gaskin.”

...

What the heck is an actinic collumn

...

actinic column that eventually rose ffty or sixty feet in the air, appeared to stabilize, and started to spin slowly

...

Awww i feel bad for the brothers

...

We never intended this,” he said weakly. “Honestly. No offense. We just wanted what was due to us.” A skeletal hand patted him on the shoulder, not unkindly. And Death said, CONGRATULATIONS.

...

The Librarian leaned cautiously over the top of the bookcase and unfolded an arm into the darkness

...

Figgin supreme grand master doesnt own a dictionary lol

...

I shall form a new secret society of keen-minded and intelligent men, although not too intelligent of course, not too intelligent. And we will overthrow the cold tyrant and we will usher in a new age of enlightenment and fraternity and humanism and Ankh-Morpork will become a Utopia and people like Brother Plasterer will be roasted over slow fres if I have any say in the matter, which I will. And his fggin.1

“I never did like them Klatchians,” said the woman frmly. “The stuff they eat! It’s disgustin’. And gabblin’ away all the time in their heathen lingo . . .”

...

Ank is  fucked place

...

1A number of religions in Ankh-Morpork still practiced human sacrifce, except that they didn’t really need to practice anymore because they had got so good at it. City law said that only condemned criminals should be used, but that was all right because in most of the religions refusing to volunteer for sacrifce was an offense punishable by

landing in the tangled gewgaws of the hoard. It was a peanut shell.

...

A fgure loomed out of the billows. Another

...

A fgure loomed out of the billows. Another one of ’em, thought Vimes. Well, there’s no law about wearing long black robes and deep cowls. There could be dozens of perfectly innocent reasons why this person is wearing long black robes and a deep cowl and standing in front of a melted-down house at dawn.

...

This is where he saw wonse

...

Vetinari is actually kinda dope

...

It was a perfectly normal dungeon door, but it all depended on your sense of perspective. In this dungeon the Patrician could hold off the world. All that was on the outside was the lock. All the bolts and bars were on the inside.

...

They are so stupid trying to make the odds worse lol

...

“So what we’ve got to do, then,” said Nobby slowly, “is adjust the odds . . .

...

Makes sense apes are freakishly  strong

...

There were a couple of dull “things” as the bars gave up and broke free. The ape fung them aside and reached into the gaping hole.

...

those guards don’t know how to treat—” she began. “No time, no time,” said Vimes, grabbing her arm. It was like trying to drag a mountain. The cheering stopped, abruptly. There was a sound behind Vimes. It was not, particularly, a loud noise. It just had a peculiarly nasty carrying quality. It was the click

...

else get there frst. It said, he looks ready to kill, no one’s

four sets of talons hitting the fagstones at the same time

The dragon kennels exploded

Good grief. I’m watching the frst ever dragon to fame backward. He risked

...

But it might just work,

...

Cant men be bitches too cant women be bastards

...

Why don’t you fght the bastard!” shouted Nobby, at the dwindling dragons. “Bitch, Nobby,” said Vimes quietly. “Not bastard. Bitch.” “Why don’t you f–what?” “It’s a member of the female gender,” explained Lady Ramkin. “What?”

...

I thought there were only bad people

...

You see, the only thing the good people are good at is overthrowing the bad people

something else,” she said. “What was it, now? Oh, yes: ‘It’s a million to one chance,’ ” said Lady Ramkin, “I think he said, ‘but it might just work.’

...

Awww the two dragons

...

two specks, one big, one small, few out of the shadow, skimmed low across the swells of the Rim ocean, and struck out determinedly over the totally unfathomable, star-dotted depths of space. Perhaps the magic would last. Perhaps it wouldn’t. But then, what does? THE END
