This is a crazy opening

...

O mighty Caliph and Commander of the Faithful, I am humbled to be in the splendor of your presence; a man can hope for no greater blessing as long as he lives. The story I have to tell is truly a strange one, and were the entirety to be tattooed at the corner of one’s eye, the marvel of its presentation would not exceed that of the events recounted,

...

Lol this is actually quite true we could make gold from brass but it's  hard lso the creation process can take away value 

...

“They seek a source of gold that is cheaper than mining ore from the ground. Alchemy does describe a means to make gold, but the procedure is so arduous that, by comparison, digging beneath a mountain is as easy as plucking peaches from a tree.”

...

Worm holes

...

like the holes that worms bore into wood,

...

What does not come back i love this 

...

“Four things do not come back: the spoken word, the sped arrow, the past life, and the neglected opportunity,”

...

Is going back in time to fuck the younger version of your lover cheating?

...

When the older Hassan returned from his trip to Damascus, Raniya was home waiting for him. She greeted him warmly, but kept her secrets to herself.

...

That is both sad and true

...

Nothing erases the past. There is repentance, there is atonement, and there is forgiveness. That is all, but that is enough.

...

Wtf is going on 

...

We all keep spare sets of full lungs in our homes, but

...

Literally a century?

...

I attended a century ago,

...

Their world is round

...

Somewhere above the limits of our vision, the chromium walls surrounding our world must curve inward to form a dome; our universe is a sealed chamber rather than an open well. And air is gradually accumulating within that chamber, until it equals the pressure in the reservoir below.

...

Their world is round people might not believe him

...

This is a good allegory for increasing entropy.

...

The engine itself was powered by air from the reservoir, and for every lungful of air that it produced, the engine consumed not just a lungful but slightly more. It did not reverse the process of equalization but, like everything else in the world, exacerbated it.

...

Sourdce of the title

...

All my desires and ruminations are no more and no less than eddy currents generated by the gradual exhalation of our universe. And until this great exhalation is finished, my thoughts live on.

...

I am a strange loop like klara and the sun the idea that your brain lives on in others by sharing thoughts

...

Which is why I have written this account. You, I hope, are one of those explorers. You, I hope, found these sheets of copper and deciphered the words engraved on their surfaces. And whether or not your brain is impelled by the air that once impelled mine, through the act of reading my words, the patterns that form your thoughts become an imitation of the patterns that once formed mine. And in that way I live again, through you.

...

This is the heat death of the universe

...

I wish you well, explorer, but I wonder: Does the same fate that befell me await you? I can only imagine that it must, that the tendency toward equilibrium is not a trait peculiar to our universe but inherent in all universes. Perhaps that is just a limitation of my thinking, and your people have discovered a source of pressure that is truly eternal. But my speculations are fanciful enough already.

...

This beautiful way to think about death

...

Contemplate the marvel that is existence, and rejoice that you are able to do so. I feel I have the right to tell you this because, as I am inscribing these words, I am doing the same.

...

Quantum Mechanics might be a refusal of determinism

...

Why should anything change? “No action you took last month was any more freely chosen than one you take today,” a doctor might say. “You can still behave that way now.” The patients invariably respond, “But now I know.” And some of them never say anything again.

...

Beliefs are very powerful more than we give them credit

...

Pretend that you have free will. It’s essential that you behave as if your decisions matter, even though you know they don’t. The reality isn’t important; what’s important is your belief,

...

Spooky story about lack of free will

...

Because I had no choice.

...

It's Hard to tell when these people are in the digital versus the real world

...

A year later, and Blue Gamma is days away from its big product launch. Ana is at work in her cubicle,

...

I feel like ted Chiang understands physics a bit better than he does software. I can't  imagine training software in the way you would a child 

...

The current instances of the release candidates will be kept as mascots, and copies will be available for purchase, but the expectation is that most people will buy younger digients, when they’re still prelinguistic. Teaching your digient how to talk is half the fun; the mascots primarily serve as examples of the kind of results you can expect. Selling prelinguistic digients also allows them to be sold in non-English-speaking markets, even though Blue Gamma only has enough staff to raise mascots in English.

...

I feel like ted Chiang understands physics a bit better than he does software. I can't  imagine training software in the way you would a child. I feel like you would train one or two and have them train the others at high speed.

...

This is quite sad that they lose their experience 

...

So the digients lose three days of experience. Including the first time they rolled down a hill.

...

Lmfaoooo this digient causes someone pain just to hug them and get praise lol

...

Next thing I know, she pushes over another digient to make him cry, hugs him, and looks to me for praise!

...

Wtf is a lolly

...

Coco is a Lolly,

...

I feel like a lot of people grow up in this way. It's why so many people want biological children.

...

The child was a walking bundle of neuroses, the result of growing up as a monument to his father’s narcissism. Even a digient deserves more respect than that.

...

Love interest? They'll be fucking?

...

Derek and Ana burst out into laughter. She closes the windows and says, “You did some terrific work there.”

...

Do they have to wear the avatar just because its too weird to learn off of regular avatars 

...

they’ll have to wear the avatars themselves when raising the digients, and controlling tentacles will be difficult enough.

...

She’d prefer to shield Blue Gamma’s mascots from what’s happening,

...

Cause they be fucking lol

...

“Right,” says Derek. Wendy was also uncomfortable with the amount of time he’s been spending with Ana, but there’s no point in mentioning that.

...

Yep theyre going to be fucking for sure

...

The last time he felt so much in common with a woman was when he met Wendy,

...

Yup it's gonna happen

...

he might ask Ana out, but there’s no point in speculating about that now. The most they can be is friends, and that’s good enough.

...

This is sily if they're concious they should be able to exist together without humans

...

Derek thinks the idea is ridiculous—a bunch of abandoned children aren’t going to become autodidacts no matter how many books they’re left with—so he’s not surprised to read about the results: every test population eventually goes feral. The digients don’t have enough aggression in them to descend into Lord of the Flies–style savagery; they simply divide into loose, nonhierarchical troops. Initially, each troop’s daily routines are held together by force of habit—they read and use eduware when it’s time for school; they go to the playgrounds to play—but without reinforcement these rituals unravel like cheap twine. Every object becomes a toy, every space a playground, and gradually the digients lose what skills they had. They develop a kind of culture of their own, perhaps what wild digient troops would demonstrate if they’d evolved on their own in the biomes.

...

Called that shit 

...

The person he wants to talk to is, of course, Ana. What once seemed a groundless fear of Wendy’s has come true; he has definitely developed feelings for her beyond friendship.

...

Has jax become more coherent or am i just getting used to his speaking style

...

“Drayta weird,” says Jax. “Yes, he was, wasn’t he?” “All Draytas like that?”

...

Derek is such a weirdo

...

Derek figures that in telling Ana about his divorce, he’ll be reminding her that there are other options, that not every

...

She knows i think 

...

Derek is stunned. “Congratulations,” he says.

...

Such a clear hint

...

women he dates don’t share his interest in digients, but

...

She wants him too

...

She pauses, and then says,

...

It's About consciousness

...

As she did at the time, Ana again tries to pin down exactly why nonsexual relationships with animals can be healthy while sexual ones can’t, why the limited consent that animals can give is sufficient to keep them as pets yet not to have sex with them.

...

Derek makes a good point

...

From: Derek Brooks What’s intrinsic? There was no intrinsic need for digients to have charming personalities or cute avatars, but there was still a good reason for it: they made people more likely to spend time with them, and that was good for the digients. I’m not saying we should accept Binary Desire’s offer. But I think what we need to ask ourselves is, If we make the digients sexual, would that encourage other people to love them in a way that’s good for the digients?

...

Shes  not just talking about digients shes talking about derek

...

strengthen them. But how far could that strengthening go? How close a relationship could one have before sex became an issue? Later that evening, she posts a reply to Derek’s comment:

...

I think the roll back is fine actually

...

But if the human is free to customize the digient’s reward map, or keep rolling him back until he finds a perfectly tweaked instantiation,

...

The idea of free will is interesting here

...

“A huge difference. But you know, that raises an interesting question.” He tells her about his conversation with Marco and Polo. “I’m not sure if Marco was just arguing for the sake of arguing, but it made me think. If a digient volunteers to undergo the changes that Binary Desire wants to make, does that make a difference?”

...

valuable than a database was a product of experience. She

...

Eh i don't  think he's right

...

She wants to tell them that Blue Gamma was more right than it knew: experience isn’t merely the best teacher; it’s the only teacher.

...

Eh i don't  think Ted's right

...

Or let the robots choose if they want to be prostitutes 

...

Ana contemplates the user group’s remaining options. As far as she can tell, there’s only one: working for Polytope and trying to convince them that the Neuroblast engine is worth porting. All she has to do is wear the InstantRapport patch and join their experiment in industrialized caregiving.

...

Exactly he should let the digients vote on iy

...

Except that he can’t. Not when there’s an alternative: accepting Binary Desire’s offer.

...

Exactly he should let the digients vote on it

...

This is the tragic love story

...

Is it better for Marco to have his brain chemistry altered than for Ana to alter hers?

...

that this enormous obstacle to Jax’s future has been removed, and she

...

Its crazy that she didnt put 2 and 2 together 

...

she didn’t have to take the job with Polytope to do it.

...

This is a well written parellel to derek

...

Imagines him making sacrifices, some hard and some made easy because they’re for a person he truly cares about.

...

keep the pendulum vertical, there is no need for subsequent correction.”

...

This is a well known controls problem

...

“Indulgence leads to misbehavior, which angers the nanny and prompts her to deliver punishment more severe than is warranted. The nanny then feels regret, and subsequently overcompensates with further indulgence. It is an inverted pendulum, prone to oscillations of ever-increasing magnitude. If we can only keep the pendulum vertical, there is no need for subsequent correction.”

What prompted the institute’s staff to seek Lambshead’s opinion was Edmund’s diminutive stature: although he was five, his height and weight were those of the average three-year-old. The children at the Brighton Institute were generally taller and healthier than those at similar asylums, a reflection of the fact that the institute’s staff did not follow the still-common practice of minimal interaction with the children.

...

Okay this is an interesting twist i take it back

...

Nanny; it was the result of being deprived of the Automatic Nanny after his father felt he was ready for human care.

...

This is such a sad story about robotic nannies

...

The Automatic Nanny seen here is the one purchased by Dr. Lambshead to improve Edmund’s care at the Brighton Institute. All the Nannies in Lionel Dacey’s possession were destroyed upon his son’s death. The National Museum of Psychology thanks Dr. Lambshead for his donation of this unique artifact.

...

I think a lot of people think this way about spell check

...

But there is still the past me who would have been appalled to see his daughter lose her ability to spell, and I can’t deny that I am continuous with him.

...

This is an abrupt transition 

...

It was the summer of Jijingi’s

...

Oh no these are the most dangerous type of european visitor

...

“This European is a missionary; that means all he does is pray. He has no authority to punish us, but our making him welcome will please the men in the administration.”

...

I wonder how this relates to the first story 

...

“No, I can teach it to you. Would you like that?” Cautiously, Jijingi nodded.

...

That is a good analogy for words i would also struggle to describe what  word is perhaps because i never took a li nguistics course

...

By leaving spaces when he wrote, Moseby was making visible the bones in what he said.

...

cognitive cyborgs, effectively incapable of misremembering anything;

...

The ability to forget is a wonderful feature of the human mind

...

Mhmm the idea that we forget a little then forgive then forget is interesting

...

In most cases we have to forget a little bit before we can forgive; when we no longer experience the pain as fresh, the insult is easier to forgive, which in turn makes it less memorable, and so on. It’s this psychological feedback loop that makes initially infuriating offenses seem pardonable in the mirror of hindsight.

...

Either this is a very kind man or a deceptive one. He hasn't  told what he did wrong and in doing so suggests he hasn't whether this is true or not determines how good of a person he is

...

Would those years of repair have been possible with Remem?

...

Semantic knowledge is general facts and episodic of life events

...

Psychologists make a distinction between semantic memory—knowledge of general facts—and episodic memory, or recollection of personal experiences.

...

She'll  have access to her norml episodic memory

...

How will it change a person’s conception of herself when she’s only seen her past through the unblinking eye of a video camera?

...

She'll  have access to her norml episodic memory but perhaps it grows weaker with lack of use

...

She'll  have access to her norml episodic memory but perhaps it grows weaker with lack of use also i wonder if the use of she pronouns is because he is thinking of his daughter

...

Are the lies we tell ourselves worth protecting

...

Our memories are private autobiographies, and that afternoon with my grandmother features prominently in mine because of the feelings associated with it. What if video footage revealed that my grandmother’s smile was in fact perfunctory, that she was actually frustrated because her sewing wasn’t going well? What’s important to me about that memory is the happiness I associate with it, and I wouldn’t want that jeopardized.

...

Bull shit it def could hasn't  he ever seen a movie

...

It seemed to me that continuous video of my entire childhood would be full of facts but devoid of feeling, simply because cameras couldn’t capture the emotional dimension of events.

...

I think people will still grasp at things and form their own narratives

...

But, I wondered, if everyone remembered everything, would our differences get shaved away? What would happen to our sense of self? It seemed to me that a perfect memory couldn’t be a narrative any more than unedited security-cam footage could be a feature film.

...

SHoukd we protect the lies we tell ourselves our memories both make things better then they were but also makes them worse than they were author doesn't consider the fact that our memories can make things worse.

...

The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling

Marriage is like buying a person quite awful sometimes

...

Umem’s wife Girgi has run away from home and gone back to her kin. Her kinsman Anongo has tried to convince her to stay with her husband, but Girgi refuses, and there is no more Anongo can do. Umem demands the return of the £11 he paid as bridewealth. Anongo says he has no money at the moment, and moreover that he was only paid £6. Sabe requested witnesses for both sides. Anongo says he has witnesses, but they have gone on a trip. Umem produces a witness, who is sworn in. He testifies that he himself counted the £11 that Umem paid to Anongo. Sabe asks Girgi to return to her husband and be a good wife, but she says she has had all that she can stand of him. Sabe instructs Anongo to repay Umem £11, the first payment to be in three months when his crops are salable. Anongo agrees.

...

Yeah it feels weird that i can buy groceries  because i did some analysis for somebody

...

“Selling vegetables to pay back bridewealth,”

...

This is how the stories connect the precise story is the camera vimi and the memory is mimi

...

“But that doesn’t mean he was lying.” Then Jijingi remembered something about the European language, and understood Moseby’s confusion. “Our language has two words for what in your language is called ‘true.’ There is what’s right, mimi, and what’s precise, vough. In a dispute the principals say what they consider right; they speak mimi. The witnesses, however, are sworn to say precisely what happened; they speak vough. When Sabe has heard what happened he can decide what action is mimi for everyone. But it’s not lying if the principals don’t speak vough, as long as they speak mimi.”

...

This is how the stories connect the precise story is the camera vough and the memory is mimi

...

Violence exploitation and a diverse population

...

There was no denying their wealth or power, but who knew what was the cause?

...

Violence exploitation and a diverse population would love to read a book on this

...

That is a good idea

...

if your actions were recorded in their lifelog, you have access to the footage in which you’re present.

...

That is crazy twist

...

“You’re the reason she left. You drove her away! You can leave, too, for all I care. I sure as hell would be better off without you.”

...

The lengths we go through to lie to ourselves lol

...

Initially I was angry as I watched, angry at Nicole for going to such lengths to create this lie, because the preceding footage was all consistent with me being the one who yelled at her. Then some of what I was saying in the video began to sound queasily familiar: complaining about being called to her school again because she’d gotten into trouble, accusing her of spending time with the wrong crowd. But this wasn’t the context in which I’d said those things, was it? I had been voicing my concern, not berating her. Nicole must have adapted things I’d said elsewhere to make her slanderous video more plausible. That was the only explanation, right?

...

We should not protect the lies we tell ourselves

...

I would have testified, hand on a stack of Bibles or using any oath required of me, that it was Nicole who’d accused me of being the reason her mother left us. My recollection of that argument was as clear as any memory I had, but that wasn’t the only reason I found the video hard to believe; it was also my knowledge that—whatever my faults or imperfections—I was never the kind of father who could say such a thing to his child.

...

Wait this is occuring during modern times

...

A truck carried goods along the motor road into Katsina-Ala every fifth day,

...

Damn i got the spot on 

...

“Sure,” she said. “You’re always acting like you’re the victim, like you’re the good guy who deserves to be treated better than you are.”

...

Not remembering things right is so common sabe doesnt know who they're decended from and hes the elder

...

The elders in the western farms were right, and Sabe was wrong: Shangev was not Kwande’s son; he was Jechira’s.

...

De jour what is written vs de factor what is down in practice

...

The assessment report of the Europeans was vough; it was exact and precise, but that wasn’t enough to settle the question. The choice of which clan to join had to be right for the community; it had to be mimi. Only the elders could determine what was mimi; it was their responsibility to decide what was best for the Shangev clan. Asking Sabe to defer to the paper was asking him to act against what he considered right.

...

To think of hidtory as a religion is very interesting. But doesn't the objective truth matter 

...

Before a culture adopts the use of writing, when its knowledge is transmitted exclusively through oral means, it can very easily revise its history. It’s not intentional, but it is inevitable; throughout the world, bards and griots have adapted their material to their audiences and thus gradually adjusted the past to suit the needs of the present. The idea that accounts of the past shouldn’t change is a product of literate cultures’ reverence for the written word. Anthropologists will tell you that oral cultures understand the past differently; for them, their histories don’t need to be accurate so much as they need to validate the community’s understanding of itself. So it wouldn’t be correct to say that their histories are unreliable; their histories do what they need to do.

...

Who is speaking now???

...

It would be easy for me to assert that literate cultures

...

This makes me want to journal more to be afraid of the subjectove history i tell

...

Because all of us have been wrong on various occasions, engaged in cruelty and hypocrisy, and we’ve forgotten most of those occasions. And that means we don’t really know ourselves. How much personal insight can I claim if I can’t trust my memory? How much can you? You’re probably thinking that, while your memory isn’t perfect, you’ve never engaged in revisionism of the magnitude I’m guilty of. But I was just as certain as you, and I was wrong. You may say, “I know I’m not perfect. I’ve made mistakes.” I am here to tell you that you have made more than you think, that some of the core assumptions on which your self-image is built are actually lies. Spend some time using Remem, and you’ll find out.

...

This is so ironic and well written

...

The account I’ve given of the Tiv is based in fact, but isn’t precisely accurate. There was indeed a dispute among the Tiv in 1941 over whom the Shangev clan should join with, based on differing claims about the parentage of the clan’s founder, and administrative records did show that the clan elders’ account of their genealogy had changed over time. But many of the specific details I’ve described are invented. The actual events were more complicated and less dramatic, as actual events always are, so I have taken liberties to make a better narrative. I’ve told a story in order to make a case for the truth. I recognize the contradiction here.

...

This was a crazy story

...

yourself. And if you think I’ve been less than honest, tell me. I want to know.

...

Should we protect the lies we tell ourselves our memories both make things better then they were but also makes them worse than they were author doesn't consider the fact that our memories can make things worse.

...

I find this to be very funny

...

I suppose I can’t blame them. We parrots used to think humans weren’t very bright.

...

What would it take for a me to respectthe conciousness of an animal

...

So the extinction of my species doesn’t just mean the loss of a group of birds. It’s also the disappearance of our language, our rituals, our traditions. It’s the silencing of our voice.

...

This is so sad 

...

The message is this: You be good. I love you.
