This seems pretty sad it seems like they're robots for children

What the heck happened to her

had a single unified picture of the view before me. The front alcove was in the box furthest to my right, as might be expected; and yet the magazines table, which was nearest the front alcove, had become divided between various boxes, so that one section of the table could even be seen in the box furthest to my left.

breath became short and she clung tightly to me.

...

Whats happening tuesday

...

‘Okay, coming!’ Then Josie said quietly to Rick: ‘Tuesday lunchtime, okay?’

...

What the fuck did the boy miss out on

...

‘Look, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I’m so stupid, I just open my mouth and…’ She sobbed, then continued loudly: ‘And now you all know it, know for certain I’m the world’s greatest fool! It was just that nice boy, it seems so unfair…Chrissie, I’m so sorry.’

...

quietly: ‘Do you suppose Sal

...

Who is Sal

...

Whats a lifted kid

lifted kids.’

...

‘Oh…’ Her face became serious, then she said: ‘That’s Sal.

...

Is sal dead?

...

Josie dad is out of the picture for some reason maybe sals deatg

...

‘What? Oh no. He was…substituted. Like all the rest of them. He was a brilliant talent. Still is, of course. We get along better now. That’s the important thing for Josie.’

...

Josie dad is out of the picture for some reason maybe sals death

...

This is the first time ive heard klara think something pretty evil

...

At that moment it felt to me some great error had been made that the creature should be allowed to stand in the Sun’s pattern at all, that this bull belonged somewhere deep in the ground far within the mud and darkness, and its presence on the grass could only have awful consequences.

...

Shes very good at noticing intent

...

kindness – the exact opposite of the terrible bull from earlier.

...

Ricky is unlifted which mkes him less than the other kids for some reason his mother is reclusive

...

Rick was silent, gazing at the picture. Josie, despite her announcement, continued to add to her picture.

...

Ricks mom also wants him to go to college it is rick who doesnt wa t to go

...

They’re either members of TWE, which forbids its members to take unlifted students, or else they’re bandits demanding ridiculous fees which we of course are in no position to offer. But then we heard you’d arrived next door, and I had a marvelous idea.’

This is  very interesting perspective rick wants to stay home

...

‘He’s convinced himself he can’t go away and leave me here. Of course, I can manage perfectly well. But he likes to pretend I’m quite helpless, likely to get up to all sorts of mischief in his absence.’

Klara is performing a prayer

...

‘Please make Josie better. Just as you did Beggar Man.’

She can have strange visions

‘That’s not going to be possible,’ and Boy AF Rex saying, ‘You’re so selfish, Klara.’ And I said:

So a small sex act

Guy can manipulate josie mom using sal

‘Ma’am love Miss Josie. But Miss Sal die and mess Ma’am up bad. Get me, AF?’

...

What happened here

...

‘No! No pain! But I want Mom! Get Mom! I need her here!’ Not only was her voice loud, it was as if it had been folded over onto itself, so that two versions of her voice were being sounded together, pitched fractionally apart. I’d never before heard her produce such a voice and for a second became hesitant. She brought herself up into a kneeling position and now I saw the duvet hadn’t disintegrated after all, but was in a large ball behind her. ‘Get Mom!’ ‘But your mother

Josie there, suspended in the air. She wasn’t very high – her feet were at the height of my shoulders – but because she was leaning forward, arms outstretched, fingers spread, she seemed to be frozen in the act of falling. Little beams illuminated her from various angles, forbidding her any refuge. Her face was very like that of the real Josie, but because there was at the eyes no kind smile, the upward curve of her lips gave her an expression I’d never seen before. The face looked disappointed and afraid. Her clothes weren’t real clothes, but made from thin tissue paper to approximate a T-shirt on her top half, loose-fitting shorts on the lower. The tissue was pale yellow and translucent and under the sharp lighting made this Josie’s arms and legs look all the more fragile. Her hair had been tied back in the manner the real Josie wore it on her ill days, and this was the one detail that failed to convince; the hair had been made from a substance I’d never seen on any AF, and I knew this Josie wouldn’t be happy with it.

...

She made an af of Sal 

...

It didn’t work with Sal, why will it work with Josie?’

...

This is soo creepy

...

we want you to inhabit that Josie up there with everything you’ve learned.’

...

Does getting lifted make you sick?

...

don’t blame Paul. He’s entitled to his feelings. After Sal, he said we shouldn’t risk it. So what if Josie doesn’t get lifted? Plenty of kids aren’t. But I could never have that for Josie. I wanted the best for her. I wanted her to have a good life. You understand, Klara? I called it, and now Josie’s sick. Because of what I decided. You see how it feels for me?’

Lol she said this oiek  good thing

fascistic leanings. He always has done though I always tried not to notice…’

...

Oh helen youre funny

...

‘for suggesting you and your new friends were fascists. I shouldn’t have done so. It’s just that you did say you were all white people and all from the ranks of the former professional elites. You did say that. And that you were having to arm yourselves quite extensively against other types. Which does all sound a little on the fascistic side…’

This is where i laughed at good oxtail place helen is so conceited

Is she prostituting herself

...

‘If you wish, Vance, we can arrange to meet again. Let’s say in two years’ time in this very place. Then you could check to see I’ve been keeping my promise. You could look me over and check that I’ve been punishing myself properly…’

...

– or rather, various parts of it within several of the boxes

...

I hate the mother

...

The Mother had said all this while staring at the dark sky, but she now turned to face Rick.

...

This is so sd

...

She’d hoped, I knew, that Rick would come to wave her off. But as it turned out, he was many miles away that day, meeting his new friends to talk about his hard-to-detect data-gathering devices. So it was just myself and the New Housekeeper who stood in the loose stones area, watching Josie and the Mother place the last of her luggage in the Mother’s car.

...

This is so sad

...

‘I wonder what Rick can mean by that?’ ‘I suppose

...

I love this way of looking at people you've  left behind

...

‘I suppose I’m saying Josie and I will always be together at some level, some deeper one, even if we go out there and don’t see each other any more. I can’t speak for her. But once I’m out there, I know I’ll always keep searching for someone just like her.

...

Rosa was harmed by her human

...

Rosa, sitting on the rough ground somewhere outdoors, little pieces of metal scattered around her, as she reached out both hands to grasp one of her legs stretched out stiffly before her. The image was in my mind for only a second, but the animal carried on making its noise, and I felt the ground collapsing beneath me. I remembered the terrible bull on the walk up to Morgan’s Falls, and how in all probability it had emerged from beneath the ground, and for a brief moment, I

...

The barn filled even more intensely with orange light, and I saw again Rosa, on the hard ground wearing an expression of pain, reaching forward to touch her outstretched leg.
